                <p>
                Hi! My name is Adrian Ramos. I am a 3rd year Human Physiology Major at the University of Oregon. I am very passionate about learning about the anatomy of the human body and also the physiology of the human body.
                I am also interested in technology. With my interests in technology, I am pursuing a minor in CIT. Following a human physiology and CIT courses here 
                at the University of Oregon has been a very fun expereince and the balance between these two courses align with my interests very well. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                While not in school, in my free time I enjoy playing soccer and also playing video games. I've been playing soccer for almost my whole life and my 
                long passion for the sport inspired me to make a soccer themed website that ties together who I am as a person and also some soccer content that I 
                have prior knowledge in. 
                </p>
